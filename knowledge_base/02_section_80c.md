## Eligible Instruments Under Section 80C

### Employee Provident Fund (EPF) — Most Common
- **Employee's contribution** to EPF counts toward 80C
- Employer's contribution does NOT count (it's tax-free up to ₹7.5L/year under Section 10)
- Employee typically contributes 12% of Basic + DA
- **This is usually already deducted from salary — check Form 16 Part B**
- For most salaried people, EPF is the FIRST thing filling up their 80C limit

### Public Provident Fund (PPF)
- Annual limit: ₹1,50,000 (aligns with 80C limit)
- Lock-in: 15 years (partial withdrawal from year 7)
- Interest rate: Government-set, currently ~7.1% (tax-free)
- One of the safest instruments + EEE tax status (exempt-exempt-exempt)

### Equity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS)
- **Shortest lock-in among 80C instruments: 3 years**
- Market-linked returns (equity mutual funds)
- LTCG on redemption taxed at 12.5% above ₹1.25L exemption
- Best for young earners who can tolerate equity volatility
- Can invest via SIP (each SIP installment has its own 3-year lock-in)

### Life Insurance Premium
- Premium paid for life insurance of self, spouse, or children
- Maximum premium eligible: 10% of sum assured (for policies after 01-Apr-2012)
- Endowment plans, ULIP premiums qualify
- Term insurance premiums qualify (and are very low, often ₹10-20K/year)

### National Savings Certificate (NSC)
- 5-year lock-in
- Interest rate: ~7.7% (compounding, taxable but accrued interest re-invested counts as fresh 80C)
- Available at post offices

### Tax-Saving Fixed Deposit
- 5-year lock-in, no premature withdrawal
- Interest rate: ~6.5-7% (varies by bank)
- Interest is TAXABLE (unlike PPF)

### Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana (SSY)
- For girl child (up to age 10 at account opening)
- Very high interest rate: ~8.2%
- EEE status (like PPF)
- Annual limit: ₹1,50,000

### Home Loan Principal Repayment
- Principal component of home loan EMI qualifies
- Must be for residential property
- If property sold within 5 years, deduction reversed

### Children's Tuition Fees
- Fees paid for full-time education of up to 2 children
- Only tuition fees (not development fees, donations, etc.)
- Paid to school/college/university in India

### Stamp Duty & Registration Charges
- On purchase of residential house property
- Claimable in the year of payment

### Senior Citizens Savings Scheme (SCSS)
- For individuals 60+ years
- 5-year tenure
- Interest: ~8.2%

### Others

## Section 80CCC: Pension Fund Contribution
- Contribution to annuity plan of LIC or other insurer
- Shares the ₹1.5L combined limit with 80C and 80CCD(1)

## Section 80CCD(1): Employee's NPS Contribution
- Employee's own contribution to NPS
- Limit: 10% of salary (Basic + DA) for salaried; 20% of gross income for self-employed
- **Shares the ₹1.5L combined limit with 80C**
- This is DIFFERENT from 80CCD(1B) which is an ADDITIONAL ₹50K

## 80C Gap Analysis Logic

### Step 1: Calculate what's already used
```
EPF_contribution = Basic_salary × 0.12 (employee share)
Other_80C = PPF + ELSS + LIC + home_loan_principal + tuition_fees + ...
Total_80C_used = EPF_contribution + Other_80C
```

### Step 2: Calculate gap
```
Gap_80C = max(0, 150000 - Total_80C_used)
```

### Step 3: Calculate tax saving from filling gap
```
If under old regime:
    marginal_rate = tax rate at the person's income level (5%/20%/30%)
    tax_saved = Gap_80C × marginal_rate × 1.04 (include cess)
```

### Step 4: Recommend specific instrument
Priority recommendation for young salaried (our target):
1. **ELSS** — if they have 3+ year horizon and can tolerate equity (shortest lock-in, market returns)
2. **PPF** — if they want safety (15-year lock-in but EEE)
3. **Term insurance** — if they don't have adequate life cover (dual purpose: protection + 80C)
4. **Tax-saving FD** — if they want guaranteed returns and are risk-averse (5-year lock-in)

### Common Pattern for Target User (₹10-30 LPA)
- Basic salary: ~40-50% of CTC
- EPF at 12% of Basic: typically ₹36,000 – ₹90,000 per year
- Gap to ₹1.5L: usually ₹60,000 – ₹1,14,000
- Tax saving from filling gap at 20% marginal rate: ₹12,480 – ₹23,712
- Tax saving from filling gap at 30% marginal rate: ₹18,720 – ₹35,568

**KEY INSIGHT:** Most young salaried professionals know about 80C but think EPF covers it. It usually doesn't — there's almost always a gap.

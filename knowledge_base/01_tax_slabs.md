|--------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| Up to ₹50 lakh          | 0%        | 0%        |
| ₹50L – ₹1 crore         | 10%       | 10%       |

## REGIME COMPARISON DECISION LOGIC

The breakeven depends on total deductions available under old regime.

**Rough heuristic for FY 2024-25:**
- If total old-regime deductions (80C + 80D + HRA + 24b + professional tax + other) > ~₹3.75L → Old regime likely better
- If total deductions < ~₹1.5L → New regime definitely better
- Between ₹1.5L – ₹3.75L → Must compute both to check

**For FY 2025-26 (Budget 2025 new slabs):**
- Breakeven shifts higher — new regime became much more attractive
- Zero-tax up to ₹12.75L under new regime vs ~₹5.5L under old
- For income ₹10-20L, you need significantly more deductions for old regime to win

**ALWAYS compute both regimes with actual numbers. Never rely on heuristics alone.**

### Computation Steps:
1. Start with Gross Total Income (salary + other income)
2. **New regime:** Subtract only standard deduction (₹75K) + employer NPS → apply new slabs → apply 87A if eligible → add cess
3. **Old regime:** Subtract standard deduction (₹50K/₹75K) + all deductions (80C, 80D, 80CCD, HRA, 24b, professional tax, etc.) → apply old slabs → apply 87A if eligible → add cess
4. Compare final tax payable under both
5. Recommend whichever has lower final tax payable

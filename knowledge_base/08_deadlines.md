# Key Tax Deadlines for Salaried Individuals

## Financial Year Calendar
- **Financial Year (FY):** April 1 to March 31
- **Assessment Year (AY):** The year after FY, when you file the return
- Example: FY 2024-25 → AY 2025-26 → ITR due July 31, 2025

## Critical Deadlines

### March 31 — End of Financial Year
- **Last date for tax-saving investments** (80C, 80D, 80CCD, etc.)
- Last date for LTCG harvesting (sell and repurchase before year ends)
- Last date for tax-loss harvesting
- **TaxHawk urgency:** If analyzed in Jan-March, this is the action deadline

### June 15 — Form 16 Issuance
- Employer must issue Form 16 by June 15 (for previous FY)
- This is when TaxHawk becomes actionable for the just-ended FY

### July 31 — ITR Filing Due Date
- Due date for individuals without audit requirement
- **Must file before this date to:**
  - Carry forward capital losses
  - Claim refund if excess TDS paid
  - Switch between old/new regime (for non-business income)
- Late filing: penalty up to ₹5,000 (₹1,000 if income < ₹5L)

### September 30 — Revised Return
- Can file revised return before December 31 of the AY (extended deadline)
- Useful if TaxHawk finds optimization after initial filing

### December 31 — Belated/Revised Return Final Date
- Last date to file belated return for the AY
- Last date to file revised return

## Advance Tax Deadlines (if applicable)
For individuals with tax liability > ₹10,000 in a year (after TDS):

| Installment | Due Date | Cumulative % |
|-------------|----------|--------------|
| 1st | June 15 | 15% |
| 2nd | September 15 | 45% |
| 3rd | December 15 | 75% |
| 4th | March 15 | 100% |

- Interest under Section 234B/234C for shortfall
- Most salaried people don't need advance tax (TDS covers it)
- Exception: significant capital gains or freelance income

## Investment Declaration Timeline (Employer)
- **April-May:** Employer asks for investment declaration for new FY
- **December-January:** Employer asks for actual investment proofs
- **February:** Employer computes final TDS based on actual investments
- **March:** Last month of salary — TDS adjusted for full year

### TaxHawk Timing Strategy
| Month | What TaxHawk Does |
|-------|------------------|
| April-June | Plan for new FY — "Here's what you should invest this year" |
| June-July | Analyze Form 16 from completed FY — "Here's what you missed + file correctly" |
| October-December | Mid-year check — "You still have time to invest before March 31" |
| January-March | **Urgency mode** — "Last chance to save ₹X before March 31" |

## Regime Selection Timing
- For salaried (non-business income): Choose at time of ITR filing
- Can switch between old/new EVERY YEAR
- No advance intimation needed to employer (employer may ask for declaration but final choice is in ITR)
- **Key insight for TaxHawk:** Even if employer deducted TDS under new regime, user can claim refund by filing under old regime if old regime results in lower tax
